### This is how we commit:

* Check for whitespaces errors `git diff —check`
* Chunk big commits into small and logics commits `git add —patch`

### This is how we label our issues on github:

* Each reported issue have to have a `type` label
* When you finish your change/fix/feature you should add the following label to the `issue` that generate that `branch`, `s:in-pull-request`

#### Priority

* p:blocker
* p:critical
* p:high
* p:low

#### Type

* t:feature
* t:bug
* t:task
* t:invalid
* t:question
* t:idea
* t:support

#### Status

* s:confirmed
* s:deferred
* s:in-pull-request
* s:in-progress
* s:incomplete
* s:rejected
* s:resolved
* s:needs-discussion
* s:help-needed

#### Information

### These are the updates we hope you make to the changelog:

Using `gulp` we should after we finish our new change/feature/fix inside our branch run `gulp` as following:

When we make backwards-compatible bug fixes

```
gulp patch
```

When we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner

```
gulp minor
```

When we make incompatible API changes:

```
gulp major
```

This `gulp` commands will add a tag with the specific version according with the version in the file `package.json`

We are following here the conventions used on [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/)

# Bug triage

This is the filter you should add to your Github view when first load the `issue page`

```
is:open is:issue no:milestone 
```

So there will be there only the issues that require some actions to categorize them, that issues should be moved to an `milestone` previous discussion.

We will find the following `milestones`:

* Actual sprint (personalized name)
* Next tasks
    * This are the most important task after the `Actual sprint`
* Blue Sky
    * This are the task that will be doing in the future, they are important enough to be saved.
* Make people happy
    * And this are all that client request for changes

This three last milestone will remain in our system, however as soon as we finish the `Actual spring` we close it.

At least each reported bug have to have a `type` label attached to it and will be ideal if it have `priority` or other labels that could help us to keep the `issue list` as clean as possible

* You can close fixed bugs by testing old tickets to see if they are happening
* You can tag bugs following the label convention explained before
* You can remove duplicate bug reports
